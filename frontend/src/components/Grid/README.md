  GridDir[Grid/] --> Index[index.js]
  GridDir --> Styles[Grid.css]
  GridDir --> Test[Grid.test.js]
```

- `index.js` — outputs classnames for base + responsive column counts.
- `Grid.css` — defines the CSS grid utility classes.
- `Grid.test.js` — unit tests ensuring class composition behaves as expected.
