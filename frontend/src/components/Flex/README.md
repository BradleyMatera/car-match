# Flex Utility

Composable flexbox wrapper with shorthand props for direction, wrapping, alignment, and gaps.

```mermaid
graph TD
  FlexDir[Flex/] --> Index[index.js]
  FlexDir --> Styles[Flex.css]
```

- `index.js` — renders a `<div>` with BEM-ish flex classes derived from props.
- `Flex.css` — defines the flexbox utility classes (direction, gap, alignment).
