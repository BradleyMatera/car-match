# Sep 3, 2025 — Delivery Summary

## Highlights
- Frontend stabilized and deployed to GitHub Pages; auth and events verified against backend.
- Backend security hardened (CORS, JWT secret + rotation). Forums endpoints added with MongoDB support.
- New Forums UI (search, pagination, pin/lock/delete/report) and standalone Messages page shipped.
- Project board automation added; statuses synced automatically.
- Repository documentation refreshed and unified.

## Changes (by area)
- Frontend
  - Added Forums feature (categories, thread list/view, replies) with moderation controls.
  - Added standalone Messages page with tabs, filters (premium‑gated), and compose.
  - Fixed “fetchMessages is not a function” by implementing mock `fetchMessages` and normalizing combined API filters.
  - Switched to `HashRouter` for GH Pages; added `homepage` and gh‑pages deploy.
  - Stability: added `.nvmrc` (Node 18), engines, and dev overrides for CRA5.

- Backend (Express)
  - CORS hardening via `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`; localhost allowed outside prod.
  - JWT strict: require `JWT_SECRET` outside dev; added `TOKEN_VERSION` with middleware validation.
  - Forums: added DB persistence with Mongoose (threads + posts models) and endpoints for create/list/read/moderate.
  - Seeded demo users/events; endpoints verified (auth, messages, events, forums).

- Tooling & CI/CD
  - GH Pages workflow added/updated; deploys on `main`, `prod`, `stage`.
  - Render blueprint (`render.yaml`) added for backend.
  - Repo variables set: `REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL`, `REACT_APP_USE_REAL_EVENTS`.

- Docs
  - Root README: refreshed overview, links, quick start, env toggles.
  - backend/README: setup, env, endpoints summary.
  - frontend/README: project quick start & deploy notes.
  - docs/DEPLOYMENT.md: Pages + Render steps clarified.
  - docs/API.md: endpoints for auth/messages/events/forums.
  - docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md: CRA dev stability, CORS/Mongo guidance.

## Deployments
- Frontend: GitHub Pages (live) — working end‑to‑end for auth, events, messaging UI.
- Backend: Render service provisioned at `https://car-match-h2gw.onrender.com/`
  - Status (truthful): auth and events are up; forums persistence not yet functional in prod. API returns `{"message":"Database not available"}` for forum create/list because Mongo isn’t connected.
  - Root cause: `MONGODB_URI` format needs `username:encoded_password@host/db` (with a colon) and a DB name in the path. Password must be URL‑encoded.

## Verification (terminal)
```
GET / -> 200 "Hello from the Car Match backend!"
GET /events -> seeded events returned (OK)
POST /login (demo/password123) -> JWT issued (OK)
POST /forums/threads -> { "message": "Database not available" } (NOT OK — pending Mongo connection)
GET /forums/categories/cat1/threads -> items: [] (expected until Mongo connects)
```

## Known Issues (today)
- Forums in production return `Database not available` because `MONGODB_URI` isn’t accepted by the driver yet.
- Zsh quoting can break `encodeURIComponent` examples that contain `!` or `#` when passed inside double‑quoted `node -e` commands.

## Notes on MONGODB_URI
- Correct shape: `mongodb+srv://USERNAME:ENCODED_PASSWORD@host.mongodb.net/car-match?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=car-match`
- Include a colon after the username, then the URL‑encoded password, then `@host/.../car-match`.
- To encode a password safely in zsh: either escape `!` as `\!`, temporarily disable history with `set +H`, or run the encode in single quotes passed directly to Node:
  - Example: `node -e 'console.log(encodeURIComponent("YourP@ssw0rd!#"))'`

## Next Steps
- Render: fix `MONGODB_URI` (ensure `username:encoded_password@host/db` + DB path), redeploy, confirm logs show "Connected to MongoDB", then re‑test forum thread/post creation.
- Project board: flip "Wire frontend to backend URL" to Done after Mongo connect; keep "Dependabot upgrades" In progress.
- Optional: auto‑promotion workflow; targeted dependency bumps to reduce advisories.
