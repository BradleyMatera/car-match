# Sep 3, 2025 — Delivery Summary

## Highlights
- Frontend stabilized and deployed to GitHub Pages with real backend wiring.
- Backend security hardened (CORS, JWT secret + rotation) and forums gained MongoDB persistence.
- New Forums UI (search, pagination, pin/lock/delete/report) and standalone Messages page shipped.
- Project board automation added; statuses synced automatically.
- Repository documentation refreshed and unified.

## Changes (by area)
- Frontend
  - Added Forums feature (categories, thread list/view, replies) with moderation controls.
  - Added standalone Messages page with tabs, filters (premium‑gated), and compose.
  - Fixed “fetchMessages is not a function” by implementing mock `fetchMessages` and normalizing combined API filters.
  - Switched to `HashRouter` for GH Pages; added `homepage` and gh‑pages deploy.
  - Stability: added `.nvmrc` (Node 18), engines, and dev overrides for CRA5.

- Backend (Express)
  - CORS hardening via `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`; localhost allowed outside prod.
  - JWT strict: require `JWT_SECRET` outside dev; added `TOKEN_VERSION` with middleware validation.
  - Forums: added DB persistence with Mongoose (threads + posts models) and endpoints for create/list/read/moderate.
  - Seeded demo users/events; endpoints verified (auth, messages, events, forums).

- Tooling & CI/CD
  - GH Pages workflow added/updated; deploys on `main`, `prod`, `stage`.
  - Render blueprint (`render.yaml`) added for backend.
  - Repo variables set: `REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL`, `REACT_APP_USE_REAL_EVENTS`.

- Docs
  - Root README: refreshed overview, links, quick start, env toggles.
  - backend/README: setup, env, endpoints summary.
  - frontend/README: project quick start & deploy notes.
  - docs/DEPLOYMENT.md: Pages + Render steps clarified.
  - docs/API.md: endpoints for auth/messages/events/forums.
  - docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md: CRA dev stability, CORS/Mongo guidance.

- Issues
  - #43 CORS hardening (closed via #45)
  - #44 JWT secret & rotation (closed via #45)
  - #42 Dependabot upgrades (in progress; safe path merged)

## Deployments
- Frontend: GitHub Pages (live)
- Backend: Render service provisioned at `https://car-match-h2gw.onrender.com/`
  - Next: finalize `MONGODB_URI` format (username:encoded_password@host/db) to enable forums persistence.

## Verification (terminal)
```
GET / -> 200 Hello from the Car Match backend!
GET /events -> seeded events
POST /login (demo/password123) -> JWT
POST /forums/threads -> Database not available (until MONGODB_URI set correctly)
```

## Next Steps
- Render: correct `MONGODB_URI` (ensure username:encoded_password@host/db), redeploy, and re‑test forum thread/post creation.
- Optionally: auto‑promotion workflow between branches; targeted dependency bumps to reduce advisories.
- Keep board in sync: `bash scripts/update_project.sh` (requires `gh` + `project` scope).
