# Car Match — September 2025 Log

Date: 2025-09-12 (Friday, Week 2)
Owner: Bradley Matera

## Week 1

Overview:
- Frontend is stable and live on GitHub Pages with the forums UI, a standalone messages page, and auth/events all working against the backend.
- Backend security tightened with CORS allowlisting and JWT token rotation/versioning.
- Forums endpoints added with Mongoose models (working locally).

Accomplishments:
- GH Pages deploy + Render blueprint working.
- Repo docs refreshed across frontend, backend, and deployment guides.

Challenges:
- Forums in prod showed “Database not available” because the Mongo URI wasn’t formatted/encoded correctly.

Next Steps:
- Fix MongoDB connection string on Render, redeploy, and confirm `/healthz` shows `connected: true` and forums persist in prod.

## Week 2 (in progress)

Focus:
- Combine settings into real features and consolidate them into the Profile page (remove separate Settings tab from the header).
- Make the Profile page UI/UX cleaner; “My Events” should only show events created by me or RSVP’d to (not the full list).

Notes:
- Events and Forums UI/UX are largely finished. The backend still needs a moderation system (roles/tiering like admin/mod) and stronger event–user ownership across the stack.

Status (Fri):
- On schedule. GH Pages now deploys only from `main` (live verified). MongoDB URI fixed on Render and `/healthz` reports `connected: true`; forum stats confirm persistence. “My Events” now correctly shows only events I created or RSVP’d to. Project hygiene complete (board, milestones, roadmap).

## Tracking Snapshot

- Issues / Board: All Week 1/2 items are filed and placed on the project board with correct status (Backlog, In Progress, In Review, Done). Open “Done” items were moved out of Done.
- Milestones: “Sept Wk 2” for in‑progress work; “Sept Wk 3/4” for backlog/follow‑ups.
- Change Orders: `docs/research/ChangeOrders.md` updated (CO‑001 through CO‑007).
