# Car Match — September 2025 Log

Date: 2025-09-12
Owner: Bradley Matera

## Week 1

Overview:
- Frontend stable and live on GitHub Pages (forums UI, standalone messages page, and auth/events) wired to the backend.
- Backend security tightened with CORS allowlist and JWT token versioning/rotation.
- Forums endpoints added with Mongoose models; working locally.

Accomplishments:
- GH Pages deploy workflow running and healthy.
- Render blueprint configured for backend; health checks in place.
- Repo docs refreshed across frontend, backend, and deployment guides.

Challenges:
- Forums in prod show "Database not available" due to malformed MongoDB URI.

Next Steps:
- Fix MongoDB connection string on Render, redeploy, and confirm `/healthz` shows `connected: true` and forum threads/posts persist in prod.

## Week 2 (in progress — ends Sun 2025-09-14)

Focus:
- Consolidate Settings into the Profile page (remove standalone header tab) and clean up any duplicated settings.
- Make Profile page UI/UX flow cleaner (reduce clutter; integrate account settings naturally).

Scope notes:
- Events and Forums UI/UX are functionally complete; backend still needs moderation roles and user tiers (e.g., admin) and to fully tie events to real/mock users.

Status:
- Realistically on schedule; continuing polish and backend finishing work.

### 2025-09-17 — Security Hardening
- Closed loop on issue #101 by adding a self-signed certificate workflow and HTTPS support for both frontend (CRA dev server) and backend (Express) during local development.
- Documented setup steps in root README, backend README, troubleshooting guide, and provided automation via `scripts/setup-dev-https.sh` for repeatability.
- Backend now listens on optional HTTPS port (`DEV_HTTPS_PORT`, default 3443) in addition to HTTP for compatibility.
- Delivered issue #103 by adding tiered rate limiting middleware (general + strict auth/messaging/forums/events rules) with centralized logging and runtime opt-out for load testing.
- Kicked off issue #105 work: Winston-based structured logging (daily rotate + dedicated security log) wired into auth, rate-limiting, messaging, and event workflows with request correlation IDs.
- Completed issue #109: Replaced Snyk with npm audit scripts/workflow so dependency scanning relies solely on GitHub Actions and local tooling.

## Current Tasks & Process Updates (Snapshot)

Issue Management:
- Review Week 1, Week 2, and current tasks; ensure each item exists as a GitHub issue.
- Update GitHub Project board so all issues are in the correct status (Backlog, In Progress, Done).
- Project view must show every issue in any status (not only completed).

File Cleanup:
- Delete stray file named `}` in `stage` branch.

New Logs:
- Maintain this monthly log and continue weekly updates (overview, accomplishments, challenges, next steps).

Documentation & Research:
- Add "Change Orders" for Activity 1.3 to `docs/research` and organize files/data correctly in Git.
- Complete Week 4 security and compliance research.

Milestones & Workflow:
- Add/update Milestones weekly with descriptions and attached issues; add future milestones for upcoming sprints.
- Maintain branch flow: feature branches → dev → stage → main with clear PR descriptions.
- Associate PRs and issues with appropriate Milestones.
