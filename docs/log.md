## 📢 &nbsp; Weekly Stand Up

Each week I will summarize my milestone activity and progress by writing a stand-up. A stand-up is meant to be a succinct update on how things are going. Use these prompts as a guide on what to write about:

⚙️ Overview - What I worked on this past week  
🌵 Challenges - What problems did I have & how I'm addressing them  
🏆 Accomplishments - What is something I "leveled up" on this week  
🔮 Next Steps - What I plan to prioritize and do next

### Week 1

⚙️ Overview:  
This week I started the Car Match project and built out the core MVP structure. I focused on designing the layout to feel like a real dating app, with a gated homepage modal, user onboarding, mock event cards, and a responsive layout. I built everything with future backend integration in mind and structured it to plug in later if needed.  

🌵 Challenges:  
A major challenge was figuring out the best way to simulate login and RSVP without having a backend. I ended up using localStorage and internal state to keep it functional for testing. Another challenge was spacing and layout on mobile—it took a few redesigns to get it balanced and clean.  

🏆 Accomplishments:  
This is the most polished frontend I’ve built from scratch. I’ve never been confident on the UI/UX side but I’m finally getting it. The project is using feature branch workflow properly now, and my planning is centralized in a living `designdoc.md`. I also made the repo public and started preparing to break down weekly milestones with proper issues.  

🔮 Next Steps:  
This week I’ll start transferring research and design breakdowns from `designdoc.md` into `R1-Notes.md`. I’m also setting up GitHub Project views, starting weekly issue tracking, and expanding the event system with better mock user behavior and error states. The layout system is locked in—now I just need to keep building.
