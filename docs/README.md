# Car Match – A Dating Platform for Car Enthusiasts

Car Match is a concept-first dating platform designed specifically for car lovers of all kinds—muscle cars, JDM, luxury vehicles, and more. This is not just a frontend mockup. The entire structure is built as a real MVP that simulates full app behavior using mocked data and realistic frontend logic, ready to plug into a real backend.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Vanilla, planning React or framework later)
- **Layout System**: Custom responsive grid using Flexbox/Grid with media queries
- **State**: Vanilla JS with `localStorage` for simulated login/session handling
- **Repository**: [GitHub - BradleyMatera/car-match](https://github.com/BradleyMatera/car-match)
- **Deployment**: Coming soon (Netlify or Vercel after MVP polish)

## MVP Overview

- Homepage modal intro (gated access flow)
- Full form-based onboarding
- Mock data for users, events, and interactions
- Structured like a real production-ready frontend
- Focus on UI/UX, accessibility, and mobile-first design
- Reorganizing editable controls into settings for proper flow
- Calendar, RSVP simulation, discussion feed on Events page
- All layouts tested for real responsiveness

## In Progress

- Conversion of `designdoc.md` into GitHub markdown files inside `/docs/research`
- Full migration of weekly standups into Issues/Milestones
- MVP UI polishing and error handling
- Research 1 being documented actively (due Sunday)
- Issue and project automation planned per Full Sail course structure

## Notes

This repo uses a proper feature branch workflow per class instructions. Feature branches will merge into `dev`, then into `stage`, and only into `main` with approval or final submissions.

If you're reviewing this for grading or feedback, please check the `/docs/research` folder and the active design work inside `designdoc.md`.
