# 359 MS 9 — Weekly Progress

## Research
- Scoped event ownership gaps across `backend/models/event.js`, `backend/server.js` routes, and `frontend/src/components/Events` (issues #111, #112).
- Catalogued current forums moderation flow on backend/frontend to inform role-based access rollout (issues #121, #122).

## Development
- Created epic-aligned tasks for event ownership enforcement (#113–#118) and forum moderation roles (#123–#128); linked them under persistent dev→staging PR #110.
- Opened milestone-long PR `359 MS 9: dev → staging (ongoing)` to collect weekly merges.

## Documentation
- Updated R4 notes (commit: pending doc PR).
- This log initialized for milestone tracking.

## Directed/Feedback
- Captured instructor sync tasks for events (#120) and moderation rollout (#130) with references to capstone dependency #14.

## Next Steps
- Kick off research spikes on ownership and moderation issues, documenting findings in the linked GitHub issues.
- Begin backend schema updates on dev branches, validating via local Mongo and test scripts before opening feature PRs against `dev`.
