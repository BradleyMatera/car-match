# Welcome! ...ðŸš€ 

This repository holds my Project & Portfolio IV work for May 2025. It documents my research, design planning, and weekly development progress for the Car Match MVP â€” a dating platform concept for car enthusiasts. This is a frontend-first build focused on clean UI, responsive layout, and mock interaction logic. Itâ€™s built to behave like a real app and structured for easy backend integration down the line.

## Overview

The Car Match MVP was started from scratch on May 4th. I focused first on building a working prototype using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. The frontend includes simulated login gating, user profile layout, events with RSVP logic, and a modular dashboard. State is managed with localStorage and mock JSON data to simulate real app behavior.

All UI structure and technical planning is detailed in `designdoc.md`. The repo is structured using feature branch workflow with dev â†’ stage â†’ main merges, and Iâ€™m using GitHub Projects, Issues, and Milestones to organize weekly deliverables.
