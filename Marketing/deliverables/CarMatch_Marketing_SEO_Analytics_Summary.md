## Executive Summary
Car Match connects car enthusiasts through a modern community experience that combines build showcases, event discovery, and meaningful conversations. Our topline launch OKRs target **1,000 weekly sessions**, **15% visit-to-signup conversion**, **≥40% DAU/MAU**, and **five co-marketing partnerships** within the first 10 weeks. The full narrative, metrics rationale, and research sit in [`../core/SEO&MARKETING.MD`](../core/SEO&MARKETING.MD) and the long-form plan [`CarMatch_Marketing_SEO_Analytics_Plan.md`](CarMatch_Marketing_SEO_Analytics_Plan.md).

## Marketing Plan
- Audience personas (Builders, Event Seekers, Connectors) and messaging pillars are summarized in the [Channel Playbook](../playbooks/CarMatch_Channel_Playbook.md).
- The phased rollout (Foundation → Soft Launch → Public Launch → Growth → Sustain) with owners and KPIs is detailed in the [Go-To-Market Roadmap](../playbooks/CarMatch_GoToMarket_Roadmap.md).
- Creative system, content cadence, and offline activations appear in the comprehensive plan [`CarMatch_Marketing_SEO_Analytics_Plan.md`](CarMatch_Marketing_SEO_Analytics_Plan.md#5-content--creative-system).

## SEO Plan
- Priority keywords map cleanly to core pages via the [SEO Keyword Map](../playbooks/CarMatch_SEO_Keyword_Map.md), covering metadata, content enhancements, and long-tail expansion ideas.
- Technical tasks (sitemaps, structured data, Core Web Vitals) and internal linking guidance live in [`../core/SEO&MARKETING.MD`](../core/SEO&MARKETING.MD#on-page-content-optimization) and Section 6 of the full plan.
- Content production workflow and governance are centralized in the same keyword map for easy sprint planning.

## Analytics Plan
- Measurement framework, GA4/ Plausible implementation, reporting cadence, and alert thresholds are captured in the [Analytics Implementation guide](../playbooks/CarMatch_Analytics_Implementation.md) and the new [Growth Playbook](../playbooks/Growth_Playbook.md).
- The plan calls for weekly Looker Studio dashboards with experiment logging—see the analytics section of [`CarMatch_Marketing_SEO_Analytics_Plan.md`](CarMatch_Marketing_SEO_Analytics_Plan.md#7-analytics--measurement) for full detail.

## Status Update
Latest snapshot drawn from the weekly status template:
- **Completed:** Structured the marketing workspace, published keyword plan, and codified analytics instrumentation.
- **In Progress:** Figma layout for launch materials, GA4 dashboard automation, Mailchimp segmentation.
- **Next:** Publish flagship blog article, launch referral badge program, and lock club partnerships.
