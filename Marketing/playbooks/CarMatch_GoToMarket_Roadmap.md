- Recruit 10 champions (club leads, influencers) for early testimonials.
- Capture qualitative feedback via Typeform or in-app messaging; log in shared UX board.

### 31-60 Days (Public Launch)

## Risk Mitigation
- **Low adoption**: Schedule weekly feedback reviews, deploy quick UX fixes, double down on champion outreach.
- **Channel fatigue**: Rotate content pillars (education, entertainment, community stories) and leverage content repurposing library.
- **Resource constraints**: Clarify owner bandwidth early; prioritize high-ROI experiments and automate recurring tasks.
- **Data gaps**: Instrument fallback tracking (Plausible, manual UTM logs) and review reports for anomalies weekly.

| ------- | ------------ | --------- | ------ | ------- |
| Growth Standup | Marketing, Product, Community | Weekly | KPIs, wins, blockers, upcoming launches | Status report, updated backlog |
