## Technical SEO & Governance
- Submit XML sitemap and ensure Search Console + Bing Webmaster Tools coverage.
- Apply structured data (Organization, Event) where relevant.
- Monitor Core Web Vitals weekly; log fixes in analytics doc.
- Maintain canonical tags for forum pagination; noindex thin profile stubs until filled.
- Review keyword ranking & click data monthly; adjust priorities accordingly.

## Content Production Workflow
1. Pull prioritized keywords into content briefs (Notion/Docs) with target intent and outline.
2. Draft copy with on-page checklist (H1 usage, 1–2% keyword density, internal/external links).
3. QA for accessibility (alt text, readable language) and performance (image compression).
4. Publish, annotate in release tracker, and submit to Search Console for indexing.
5. Revisit after 30 days to add supporting media or roll into email & social campaigns.
