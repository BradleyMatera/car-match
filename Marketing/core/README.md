# Core Marketing Narrative

`SEO&MARKETING.MD` houses the original Week 1 Capstone marketing, SEO, and analytics guide. The document now opens with an executive overview, table of contents, and links into the specialized playbooks. Treat it as the master narrative that explains *why* our growth system exists and how the individual plans connect.

- Start here to understand positioning, goals, and the research archive.
- Use the table of contents inside the file for quick navigation to marketing channels, SEO, analytics, and status update guidance.
- Supporting artifacts referenced throughout are stored in `../playbooks/` and indexed in `../deliverables/CarMatch_Marketing_SEO_Analytics_Summary.md`.
